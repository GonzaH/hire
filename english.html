          <b>M.A.D.D.I.E.:</b> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/harkano/maddie"><b>Maddie</b></a> is an open
          source discord bot to help with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.magpiegames.com/masks/"><b>Masks: A new
              generation</b></a>. One of the core mechanics in
          the game is having "moves" that have a, for example, a trigger and consequences depending on the dice result.
          The bot was designed to help with the moves so players don't have to remember everything. As a masks player, I
          found the idea wonderfull, I implemented persistence (all the info about the characters and campaign) and
          multi-language support, since I wanted to use it with other spanish speakers. My fork is <a target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/GonzaH/maddie/"><b>here</b></a>, but I think everything is already on the original
          repository.

          (from spanish: National Board Game Gathering from Argentina) and its
          backend. The page was created on a short notice and is deployed on AWS with the backend in Digital Ocean. The
          code of the webpage is in
          <a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/GonH/pagina-enjm"><b>this link</b></a>. The backend is very
          simple, is just express to generate endpoints to interact
          with a mongo db, but its in <a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/GonH/backend-enjm"><b>this
              link</b></a>. So the webpage knows the games that are being currently played I made a discord bot (the
          gathering took place mostly via Discord) to update that section, its even simpler than the backend-end and its
