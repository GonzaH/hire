Capu's resume
=============

It's a simple html/css page for my resume.
I'm happy with the graceful degradation of the flex components,
but not with the text size calculations on mobile devices
(the `text-size-adjust` is a decent ~hack~ workaround for now)

Hope someone finds it useful. Pull requests welcome.
